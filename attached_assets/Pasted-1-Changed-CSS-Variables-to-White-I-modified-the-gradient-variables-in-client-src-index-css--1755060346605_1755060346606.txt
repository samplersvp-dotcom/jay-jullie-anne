1. Changed CSS Variables to White
I modified the gradient variables in 
client/src/index.css
:

css
/* Changed from gray gradients to pure white */
--gradient-elegant: #ffffff;
--gradient-warm: #ffffff;
2. Fixed Body/HTML Background
I removed the problematic bg-background class from the body and set explicit white backgrounds:

css
body {
  background-color: #ffffff !important;
  background-image: none !important;
}

html {
  background-color: #ffffff !important;
  background-image: none !important;
}
3. Added Comprehensive CSS Override Rules
I created targeted CSS rules to force white backgrounds on all potentially problematic elements:

css
/* Force white background for invitation section and parent */
#invitation,
#invitation *,
section#invitation,
section#invitation *,
.bg-gradient-elegant,
.bg-gradient-warm,
[class*="bg-gradient"] {
  background: #ffffff !important;
  background-color: #ffffff !important;
  background-image: none !important;
}
4. Removed Pseudo-Element Overlays
I eliminated any ::before and ::after pseudo-elements that might have been creating gray overlays:

css
#invitation::before,
#invitation::after,
section#invitation::before,
section#invitation::after {
  display: none !important;
  content: none !important;
  background: none !important;
}
üîç Root Cause Analysis:
The gray shade was likely caused by:

CSS variables (--gradient-elegant, --gradient-warm) that were set to gray gradients
Tailwind classes like bg-gradient-elegant applying these gray gradients
Body background using the bg-background class which referenced a gray color variable
Pseudo-elements potentially creating overlay effects
‚úÖ The Solution:
By systematically overriding all these potential sources with !important white backgrounds and removing gradient/overlay effects, we eliminated every possible source of the gray shading while preserving your beautiful hero section background image and overall design.

The key was being comprehensive and using !important to override any existing CSS rules that were causing the gray appearance!
