change the our love story into our story, and here is the right our story "It was after class in 2013 that their paths crossed for the very first time.
In the fading light of the university parking lot, Kenneth and Jeizl were introduced with a simple exchange of names and smiles. Moments later, they were in a shared ride home with friends — Kenneth at the wheel, Jeizl in the back seat… neither of them knew that this random encounter would be the first page of their love story.

Kenneth spent the year that followed finding little ways to make Jeizl smile: a thoughtful message here, a shared meal there, and countless moments that made her feel truly seen. *It wasn’t rushed; it was steady, patient, and real.*

For more than a decade, they became each other’s safe place — growing side by side through every season of life, celebrating wins, holding on through challenges, and building a *love that feels like home.*

In 2024, surrounded by the people who matter most, Kenneth finally asked the question his heart had been holding for so long. With her “yes” they stepped into the next chapter — a lifetime of love, laughter, and the promise of forever."
