We were classmates back in high school. He was the silent type of boy — always wearing a cap and sitting quietly at the back of the room based on what I remember. I, on the other hand, was a boyish type of girl who only focused on my studies.
We didn’t have any special interaction back then — just ordinary classmates.
Fast forward to an unexpected day.
One ordinary day, someone suddenly chatted me on Messenger, saying, “Hi, kumusta?” I replied with just a simple, “Hello.”
From that simple hi and hello, our conversation grew longer and deeper — until it lasted for a year. At that time, I was in Cebu while he was in Davao. We started our story through a long-distance connection — just through phone calls and messages, yet it felt like we were always close.
During one of our conversations, I mentioned to him how strict my parents were, even though I had already finished my studies. So, I told him, “If your intentions are pure, come and visit our house — show yourself to my parents.”
Then suddenly, during the holiday vacation, he went home to Bicol — and it just so happened that I also went home for my year-end vacation. 
When we finally saw each other again for the first time since our high school graduation.  I honestly didn’t know how to react. It was my first time meeting someone I had already built such a deep connection. So instead of a hug or handshake… I went for a fist bump! 😂. He looked at me, a bit confused, wondering why a fist bump — but that moment was just so us — awkward, funny, and unforgettable. And while we were both laughing, I could still feel his nervousness — the kind of nervousness that makes your heart beat fast, yet somehow feels so right. 💖
What made it even funnier was how we showed up that day — I was just wearing my pambahay clothes, while he came in a white shirt, smelling as if he bathed in an entire bottle of perfume. That I could literally smell him even from afar! 😆.
I used to think that every love story had to be like a fairy tale, full of grand gestures, surprises and big moments but ours wasn’t like that. Our story was made up of simple gestures, quiet moments, and genuine love. There was no extravagant proposal, no big scene — just the two of us, choosing each other in the sincerest way. 💕. Giving me the kind of princess treatment I never thought I’d experience. Who would have thought that someone like me who once prided on being independent in everything would one day find comfort in depending on a man not because I needed it but because I chose to. 

And now, on our wedding day, we celebrate not just our love but the journey we’ve shared. From that simple “Hi, kumusta?” to this moment of saying “I do.” After five beautiful years together, we’re finally starting a new chapter - proof that even the simplest beginnings can lead to the most beautiful forever. 💍
